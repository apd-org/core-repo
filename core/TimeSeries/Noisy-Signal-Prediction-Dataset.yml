category: TimeSeries
description: Noisy synthetic data. There are 4 sub-datasets to this dataset. 1: A sine and a cosine with a random phase offset, X is of length 10 and Y is of length 10. 2: Two frequencies added together, X is of length 15, and Y is of length 15. Each frequency has a random phase, amplitude, and frequency (see the code for details). 3: Same as sub-dataset 2, however, a random noise is added to X, and X is rather of length 30, Y is of length 30. 4: Financial data for the bitcoin (BTC/USD or BTC/EUR), from Coindesk's API. The Requests package is required, and an internet access.
