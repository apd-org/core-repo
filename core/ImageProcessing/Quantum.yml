homepage: http://doi.org/10.4224/PhysRevA.96.042113.data
category: Quantum simulation
description: The data was generated in a numerical simulation of an electron in a 2 dimensional confining potential. It was used as a test case for training a deep neural network to reproduce the results of a partial differential equation (the time independent Schrödinger equation).
